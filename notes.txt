Notes
------
Client Macbook cannot SSH to AWS EC2 instance - use EC2 instance connect, which uses browser

CodeDeploy
-------------
- Need agent installation EC2 user script:
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y ruby
sudo yum install -y wget
cd /home/ec2-user
wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-2.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install auto
sudo service codedeploy-agent status

- it may take few min.s to complete execution of user data script, after the EC2 instance is up
check progress: /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

Logs:
/var/log/cloud-init.log 
/var/log/cloud-init-output.log

- Will deploy to EC2 instances already running that matches a tag
