Notes
------
Client Macbook cannot SSH to AWS EC2 instance - use EC2 instance connect, which uses browser
Client Macbook cannot access Flask App from Chrome (port 80, 5000 etc.)

CodeDeploy
-------------
Pre-requisite:
  - service role for CodeDeploy to handle EC2 instances
  - We will build the code from GitHub using CodeBuild and will store the zip artifact in S3 - s3://artifact-storage/aws_codepipeline_python_demo-1/myapp.zip 
  - IAM instnce profile - permission for Ec2 instance to access S3, if code is stored in S3 
    And create a role using this policy and assignto EC2 instance during instance launch

- Need Codedeploy agent installation - EC2 userdata script:
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y ruby
sudo yum install -y wget
cd /home/ec2-user
wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-2.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install auto
sudo service codedeploy-agent status
ps: Dont forget to assign 'CodeDeploy-S3-Access' role to EC2 instance

- It may take few min.s to complete execution of user data script, after the EC2 instance is up (even, after we SSH to instance)
check progress: /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

Logs:
/var/log/cloud-init.log

CodeDeploy Logs:
- Deployment logs: /opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/deployment-logs/codedeploy-agent-deployments.log
- Artifact Download path : /opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/xxxx/xxxx/deployment-archive/
- CodeDeploy Agent logs: /var/log/aws/codedeploy-agent/codedeploy-agent.log 

- Will deploy to EC2 instances already running that matches a tag

- For manual run of codedeploy, we need to create a deployment to deploy code each time
- We need to manually specify artifact each time we run deployment (?) (i.e when we create deployment), if  we manually trigger codedeploy, instead of codepipeline
